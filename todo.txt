jeez

feeling like I'm not welcome here, lol

anyways, todo:

0. Tie in a 'URL' entry to strip video ID from the link, remove the CLIENT KEY part (also make it load the API from the start to avoid the effery)
1. Create the start/stop buttons to start/stop the loop of listening
2. Quickly cycle through first few pages? Til the results stop hitting max? Or figure out if it's easy to hit the most recent comments
3. Start the loop of continually listening, cut out when the stop button is pressed
4. Create a username data holder, tie to reset button
5. Create a dynamically-updated listbox, include names & post times
6. Pull from the pages, check if the name exists, add
7. Tie everything together
8. Get the stupid API shit cleaned up so it can fail successfully


After that it's just doing some cleanup work : )
